            <h2>Stack of Pancakes</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. 
                    Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.  
                </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups of milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>
                In a large bowl, sift together the flour, 
                baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well 
                in the center and pour in the milk, egg and 
                melted butter; mix until smooth.
            </li>
            <p> </p>
            <li>
                Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan 
                over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter 
                onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup 
                for each pancake. Brown on both sides and 
                serve hot.
            </li>
        </ol>
